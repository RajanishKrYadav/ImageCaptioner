## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build an image captioning system using deep learning. Through a step-by-step Jupyter notebook (`ImageCaptioning_fixed.ipynb`), it covers:

- Data loading and preprocessing  
- Feature extraction from images (e.g., via a CNN backbone)  
- Building a sequence model (e.g., RNN or Transformer) for caption generation  
- Training, inference, and evaluation of the model  

Intended for anyone looking to explore the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing.

## Features

- **Self-contained notebook:** All code runs in one place for easy experimentation.  
- **Reproducible pipeline:** Preprocessing, model building, and evaluation are clearly structured.  
- **Flexibility:** Modify dataset paths, model architecture, and hyperparameters.  
- **Visual feedback:** Includes sample captions alongside their corresponding images.

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RajanishKrYadav/ImageCaptioner.git
   cd ImageCaptioner
   ```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate      # macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   ```

   or

   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

2. Open the notebook in your browser.

3. Run the cells sequentially:
   - Modify dataset path, batch size, epochs, model type
   - Load data and preprocess
   - Train the model
   - Generate captions
